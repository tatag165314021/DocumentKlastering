He's Been Good

I have known the Father's care for me
He's been good.. He's been good
Through it all He's always there for me
God's been (so) good to me
Through the storm.. Through the night
Come what may everything will be alright
I have known the Father's care for me
God's been good to me
Good so good.. God's been good to
Oh yes He has
Good so good.. God's been good to me X2
Oh He's been good
Good do good.. God's been good to me
