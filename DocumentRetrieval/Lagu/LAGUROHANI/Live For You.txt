Live For You

((by Sidney Mohede // Cipt. Sidney Mohede - 2000))
One thing, one thing i desire
Is to know you, as close as I can try
Your love consumes my aching heart
I will love you, not with just my words
Or my hands, but Lord with all my heart
I want to live for You alone
I live for You Lord
I live for You Lord
I will serve You as my Master
A living sacrifice
I want to live for You alone
Many are the words we say
Many songs that we can sing
But it's time we bring You something real
Not just something that we feel or require
But rather from the heart
I want to live for You alone
