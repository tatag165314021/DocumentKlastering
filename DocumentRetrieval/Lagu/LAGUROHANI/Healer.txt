Healer

Verse 
You hold my every moment 
You calm my raging seas 
You walk with me through fire 
And heal all my disease 
Pre-Chorus 
I trust in You 
I trust in You 
Chorus 
I believe You're my Healer 
I believe You are all I need 
I believe You're my Portion 
I believe You're more than enough for me 
Jesus You're all I need 
Bridge 
Nothing is impossible for You 
Nothing is impossible for You 
Nothing is impossible for You 
You hold my world in Your hands
