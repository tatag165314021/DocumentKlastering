How Great Thou Art

O Lord my God, when I'm in awesome wonder 
consider all the worlds Thy hand have made 
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder 
Thy pow'r thro'-our the universe displayed 
Chorus: 
Then sings my soul, my savior God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, How great Thou art 
Then sings my soul, my savior God, to Thee 
How great Thou art, How great Thou art 
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing 
sent Him to die,I scarce can take it in 
that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing 
He bled and died to take away my sin 
(Chorus) 
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation 
and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart 
Then I shall bow in humble adoration 
and there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art
