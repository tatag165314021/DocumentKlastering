The Wonderful Cross 

(by. Michael W. Smith) 
When I survey the wondrous cross 
On which the Prince of Glory died 
My Richest gain I count but loss 
And pour contempt on all my pride 
See from His head His hands His feet 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
Bids me come and die and find 
that I may truly live 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
All who gather here by grace 
draw near and bless your name 
Were the whole realm of nature mine 
That were an off'ring far too small 
Love so amazing so divine 
Demands my soul, my life, my all 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
Bids me come and die and find 
that I may truly live 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
All who gather here by grace 
draw near and bless your name 
Love so amazing, so divine 
Demands my soul, my life, my all 
and the beauty and the shame 
in the glory of His name 
Oh the wonderful cross 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
Bids me come and die and find 
that I may truly live 
Oh the wonderful cross (2x) 
All who gather here by grace 
draw near and bless your name
