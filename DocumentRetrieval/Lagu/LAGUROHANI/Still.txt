Still

(Words and Music by Reuben Morgan) 
Hide me now 
Under your wings 
Cover me 
within your mighty hand 
When the oceans rise and thunders roar 
I will soar with you above the storm 
Father you are king over the flood 
I will be still and know you are God 
Find rest my soul 
In Christ alone 
Know his power 
In quietness and trust
